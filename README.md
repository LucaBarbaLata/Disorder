## 📌 What Does Disorder Do?

Disorder is a Python script that simulates ransomware behavior by encrypting files in a given directory. It renames and encrypts files, making them inaccessible without a decryption key. This project is meant for educational purposes only — to understand how ransomware can operate at a basic level.
